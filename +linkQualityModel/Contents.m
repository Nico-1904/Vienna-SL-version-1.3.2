% +LINKQUALITYMODEL
% The link quality model combines the macroscopic fading, small scale
% fading, precoding and user allocation into a post-equalization SINR value
% that is calculated for all transmission layers. The post-equalization
% SINR is then handed to the link performance model that evaluates the
% achieved throughput.
